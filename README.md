## Synopsis

This is the JavaScript SDK for [element.market](https://www.element.market/), a marketplace for NFTs.

It allows developers to access the official orderbook, filter it, create buy orders (**offers**), create sell orders (**listings**), and complete trades programmatically.

You get started by [requesting an API key](https://docs.element.market/developer/public-api) and instantiating your own sdk. Then you can create orders off-chain or fulfill orders on-chain.

## Installation

Install [element-js-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/element-js-sdk), in your project, run:

```bash
npm install --save element-js-sdk
```

If your project run in browser environment, you need install [crypto-browserify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-browserify), [stream-browserify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stream-browserify), [buffer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer), and config webpack.config.js:

```bash
#install crypto-browserify, stream-browserify, buffer
npm install --save crypto-browserify
npm install --save stream-browserify
npm install --save buffer
```

```bash
#config webpack.config.js
const webpackConfig = {
    ...
    resolve: {
        ...
        fallback: {
            crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
            stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
            buffer: require.resolve('buffer/'),
        },
    },
    ...
    plugins: [
        ...
        new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
            Buffer: ['buffer', 'Buffer'],
        }),
    ],
};
```

## Getting Started

To get started, first request an API key [here](https://docs.element.market/developer/public-api). 

Then, create a new ElementJS client, using your [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5) web3Provider or signer:

```JavaScript
import { ElementSDK, Network } from 'element-js-sdk'
import { ethers } from 'ethers'

// In Browser
// https://docs.ethers.io/v5/getting-started/#getting-started--connecting
// A Web3Provider wraps a standard Web3 provider, which is what MetaMask injects as window.ethereum into each page.
const signerOrProvider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum); 

// In Node.js
// https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/
const jsonRpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/${providerApiKey}');
const signerOrProvider = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, jsonRpcProvider);

const sdk = new ElementSDK({
  // Supported networks: Network.ETH, Network.BSC, Network.Polygon, Network.Avalanche
  networkName: Network.ETH, 
  apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY,
  signer: signerOrProvider
});
```

Note that the operations: `sign orders` `erc20.approve` `erc721.setApprovalForAll` `erc1155.setApprovalForAll` done inside this sdk.

### Making Listings / Selling Items

To sell an asset, call `makeSellOrder`.

```JavaScript
const order = await sdk.makeSellOrder({
  assetId: assetId,
  assetAddress: assetAddress,
  // Value of the listing, in units of the payment token (or native token if none is specified).
  // The units are wei, and the type is string or number(e.g. 3e19).
  startTokenAmount: '3000000000000000000'
});
```

Note that the default assets is ERC-721, for ERC-1155 assets, you can set `assetSchema` to `AssetSchema.ERC1155` and pass a `quantity`:

```JavaScript
const order = await sdk.makeSellOrder({
  // ...
  assetSchema: AssetSchema.ERC1155,
  quantity: 10000,
});
```

The default payment token is native token(e.g. ETH on ether chain), if use an ERC20 token, you can set `paymentToken` to an ERC20 token address.

```JavaScript
const order = await sdk.makeSellOrder({
  // ...
  paymentToken: 'xxxx'
});
```

The default expiration time is 7 days, you can set `expirationTime` to specify another expiration time.

```JavaScript
// Note that we convert from the JavaScript timestamp (milliseconds to seconds):
const expirationTime = Math.round(Date.now() / 1000 + 60 * 60 * 24);
const order = await sdk.makeSellOrder({
  // ...
  expirationTime: expirationTime
});
```

#### Creating Dutch Auctions

To create a Dutch Auction, you should set `saleKind` to `SaleKind.DutchAuction` and set `endTokenAmount` to a small amount:

```JavaScript
const order = await sdk.makeSellOrder({
  assetId: assetId,
  assetAddress: assetAddress,
  saleKind: SaleKind.DutchAuction,
  startTokenAmount: '3000000000000000000',
  endTokenAmount: '1000000000000000000'
});
```

#### Creating English Auctions

English Auctions are auctions that start at a small amount and increase with every bid. At expiration time, the item sells to the highest bidder.

To create an English Auction, you should set `saleKind` to `SaleKind.EnglishAuction` and set `endTokenAmount` to a bigger amount:

```JavaScript
const order = await sdk.makeSellOrder({
  assetId: assetId,
  assetAddress: assetAddress,
  saleKind: SaleKind.EnglishAuction,
  startTokenAmount: '3000000000000000000',
  endTokenAmount: '5000000000000000000'
});
```

### Making Offers

You can make offers on an asset:

```JavaScript
const order = await sdk.makeBuyOrder({
  assetId: assetId,
  assetAddress: assetAddress,
  // Value of the order, in units of the payment token (or wrapped native token if none is specified).
  startTokenAmount: '3000000000000000000'
});
```

Note that make offers aren't supported with the native token, so you have to use an ERC20 token, or wrapped native token if none is specified.

#### Making Collection-Based Offers

You can make offers for any NFT from a specific collection.

```JavaScript
const order = await sdk.makeBuyOrder({
  // Note that don't specify the `assetId`
  assetAddress: assetAddress,
  // Value of the order, in units of the payment token (or wrapped native token if none is specified).
  startTokenAmount: '3000000000000000000'
});
```

### Fetching Orders

To retrieve a list of offers and auction on an asset, you can use an instance of the `ElementSDK` exposed on the client. Parameters passed into API filter objects are similar to the main [element.market api parameters](https://api.element.market/openapi/):

```JavaScript
import { ElementSDK } from 'element-js-sdk'

const { count, orders } = await sdk.queryOrders({
  asset_contract_address: assetAddress,
  token_id: assetId
});
```

The available API filters for the orders endpoint is documented in the `OrderQuery` interface below, but see the main [API Docs](https://api.element.market/openapi/#/Orders/orders) for a playground, along with more up-to-date and detailed explanantions.

```TypeScript
interface OrderQuery {
  // Filter by smart contract address for the asset category.
  asset_contract_address?: string;
  token_id?: string | number;
  // Filter by a list of token IDs for the order's asset, Needs to be defined together with asset_contract_address.
  token_ids?: Array<string | number>;
  // Filter by the kind of sell order. 0 for fixed-price sales, 1 for declining-price Dutch Auctions, 2 for English Auctions
  sale_kind?: SaleKind;
  // Filter by the side of the order. 0 for buy orders and 1 for sell orders.
  side?: OrderSide;
  // Filter by the order maker's wallet address
  maker?: string;
  // Filter by the order maker's wallet address
  taker?: string;
  // Filter by the address of the smart contract of the payment token that is accepted
  // or offered by the order, Eth and other primary chain currencies are 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  payment_token?: string;
  // How to sort the orders. Can be created_date for when they were made,
  // or eth_price to see the lowest-priced orders first (converted to their ETH values).
  // eth_price is only supported when asset_contract_address and token_id are also defined.
  order_by?: string;
  // Can be asc or desc for ascending or descending sort. Default value : desc
  direction?: string;
  // Only show orders listed before this timestamp. Seconds since the Unix epoch.
  listed_before?: number | string;
  // Only show orders listed after this timestamp. Seconds since the Unix epoch.
  listed_after?: number | string;
  // Number of orders to return (capped at 50, default is 20). Default value: 20
  limit?: number;
  // Number of orders to offset by (for pagination). Default value: 0
  offset?: number;
}
```

### Filling Orders

To buy or sell NFT, you need to fill a sell order or buy order. To do that, it's just one call:

```JavaScript
const { count, orders } = await sdk.queryOrders({ ... });
const order = orders[0]; // select an order
const transactionReceipt = await sdk.fillOrder({
  order: order
});
```

Note that if the order is a Collection-Based Offer, you need specify the `assetId`:

```JavaScript
const assetId = '';
const transactionReceipt = await sdk.fillOrder({
  order: order,
  assetId: assetId
});
```

Note that the ERC-1155 assets order can be filled partial, so that, for the ERC-1155 assets order, you need passed in the `quantity` to be fill:

```JavaScript
const quantity = '5000';
const transactionReceipt = await sdk.fillOrder({
  order: order,
  quantity: quantity
});
```

### Cancel Orders

To cancel an order, call `cancelOrder`. Note that only the maker of a given order may cancel it.

```JavaScript
const { count, orders } = await sdk.queryOrders({ ... });
const order = orders[0]; // select an order
const transactionReceipt = await sdk.cancelOrder({
  order: order
});
```

To cancel all orders of the sdk signer, you need to increase a counter named `HashNonce`. To do that, it's just call like below:

```JavaScript
const transactionReceipt = await sdk.cancelAllOrders();
```

## Advanced

Interested in purchasing for scheduling future orders, or private auctions, element.js can help with that.

### Scheduling Future Listings

You can create sell orders that aren't fulfillable until a future date. Just pass in a `listingTime` (a UTC timestamp in seconds) to your sdk instance:

```JavaScript
const order = await sdk.makeSellOrder({
  assetId: assetId,
  assetAddress: assetAddress,
  startTokenAmount: 3e19,
  listingTime: Math.round(Date.now() / 1000 + 60 * 60 * 24) // One day from now
});
```

Note that English Auctions aren't supported with `listingTime`.

### Private Auctions

Now you can make offers and listings that can only be filled by an address of your choosing. This allows you to negotiate a price in some channel and sell for your chosen price on element.market, **without having to trust that the counterparty will abide by your terms!**

Here's an example of listing a Decentraland parcel for 3 ETH with a specific buyer address allowed to take it. No more needing to worry about whether they'll give you enough back!

```JavaScript
// Address allowed to buy from you
const takerAddress = "0x123..."
const order = await sdk.makeSellOrder({
  takerAddress: takerAddress,
  assetId: assetId,
  assetAddress: assetAddress,
  startTokenAmount: 3e19
});
```
